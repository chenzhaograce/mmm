    "- The `P>|t|` column indicates the significance of each predictor. A small p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates that you can reject the null hypothesis. In other words, the predictor is significant. For instance, predictors like `affilliate_spend`, `bing_aw_spend`, and `connected_tv_aw_spend` among others are statistically significant at the 0.05 level.\n",

However, the p-value for the `holiday` variable is slightly above the typical threshold of 0.05, indicating it might not be statistically significant at the 5% level.\n",
